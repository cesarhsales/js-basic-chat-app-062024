# js-basic-chat-app-062024
A super simple chat app project I did to have some fun with node.js.

## Run
1. Start the server by running the following command in your project directory:
```
node server.js
```
2. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

You should now see the chat app interface. Open the same URL in multiple tabs or different browsers to test the real-time communication.

## Built With
- node.js (https://nodejs.org/pt)
- express (https://expressjs.com/)
- socket.io (https://socket.io/)
